# To-Do App
---

A simple To-Do app designed to help individuals and teams organize, and manage tasks and activities.

In the website, there is a simple UI for calendar and two lists. The data is stored in the app as long as the server is running on your local device.

The goal of this project is to familiarize with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and how working with server (Node js) is like. (I chose to do a simple project like this to learn parts of web development and broaden my skillset)

Feel free to explore the code and play with it.

You can:
- add items
- delete items
- cross items out

## If you're interested in trying it out, you will need:
- [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Probably Visual Studio Code or any Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com)

## To Run
1. move to the project folder by writing 'cd 'path/to/your/project/folder' (you can get the path by dragging it to the terminal as well)
2. Through the terminal, install all modules for Node js using 'npm i' or 'npm install'
3. Type 'nodemon index.js' in the terminal (in case it doesn't work, nodemon is probably missing but you can easily install nodemon as well)
